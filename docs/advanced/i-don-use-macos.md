# :question: I don't use macos.

We recommend to use macos because of consistency.  
It is because Chrome has different rendering behavior by OS.  
For example [Font issue](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/661).

It possibly makes you a big confusion hard to debug in a case across several OS used,  
So please use [GithubActions: taking fresh screens](https://yabe-diverta.github.io/katalon2puppeteer/#githubactions-taking-fresh-screens) to take fresh screen captures instead of execution in local.
