# :question: I don't use macos.

We recommend to use macos because of consistency.  
It is because Chrome has different rendering behavior by OS.  
For example [Font issue](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/661).

It possibly makes you a big confusion hard to debug in a case across several OS used.  
Please consider to run [GithubActions: taking fresh screens](/katalon2puppeteer/setup-ci/taking-fresh-screen-captures.html) instead of execution in local.
