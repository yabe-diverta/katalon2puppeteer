# Setup CI.

Push your files to Github before proceed this section:  
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "test: add test resources"
git push
```

OK, you've done all of your test before actual assertions.  
Set up CI (GithubActions) for daily testing.

You can see the [my example repo](https://github.com/yabe-diverta/nuxt-realworld/actions) when you lost a way.
